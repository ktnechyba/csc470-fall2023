# Final Plans
## Game Components
### Gameplay Description
A 3D game mix of Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker and Monument Valley 1 and 2

User will solve puzzles on screen using mouse clicks
interactions w/ NPC via computer keys or mouse click on UI dialogue box

Moving character around the puzzle scenes using arrow or WASD keys
- during battles, player just moves and attacks with keyboard keys
- Total of 3 lives -> get to zero, progress not saved => die by losing health in battle
  - after each death that doesn't reach zero, items used don't replenish -> only replenish after 
  official death
- both characters have same amount of health
Character 1 = swordsman
  - faster attack - less damage and less cooldown time
  - stamina regenerates at medium speed
Character 2 = mage
  - mana limitations, slow regeneration time
  - can wack with magic staff only if mana below certain level
  - more damage -> more time between magic attacks
### Visual and Audio Style
I'm hoping to keep the more cartoon like aesthetic used in the 05_units assignment -> pastels
- more rounded, cartoon-y, less realistic characters
-more muted colors and such during battles
I think I want to have the dialogue look like it's being typed out, but I don't think I want the 
NPCs to make noise when speaking.

I want to use more calming music - I really like the music in Monument Valley
- clicking on buttons and pieces of the puzzle that move/change the layout of things will create a sound
- perhaps some lo-fi music or sweet instrumentals that are akin to some Studio Ghibli soundtracks
- battles will have more rushed, slightly more intense  music
- taking damage, damaging others, using a potion, and defeating the bosses will have different sounds
- dying will have a different sound

### Story/Theme
Solve puzzles and defeat the enemy

As a sheltered character, you want to spread your wings, so you go on an adventure.
You've heard stories about other adventurers helping clear the land of evil monsters. There is 
currently one evil duo left, but they have protected themselves, hiding away to gain more power, 
by creating puzzle on the land. Occasionally, they will come out and wreak havoc on the people.
None of the previous adventurers have been able to solve the puzzles AND defeat the duo. Naive and
full of hope and confidence, you decide to embark on this journey.
